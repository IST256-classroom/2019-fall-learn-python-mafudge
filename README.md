Source Code Repository for the IST256 Python course at Syracuse University!

## Important

If you're enrolled in IST256, you should NOT clone this Repository directly. Instead you should use the invite code issued through GitHub classroom, which can be found on our course website.

## About the code in this Repository

This repository contains all of the code artifacts from the course, specifically:

- **Watch Me Code**: The in-lecture code demonstrations. These are usually short and to the point.
- **End-To-End Examples**: The in-lecture real-world programming examples. These are longer code examples which solve an actual problem.
- **Class Coding Lab**: The class coding labs walk you through a programming exercise. They're designed to get your feet wet prior to working on the homework.
- **Now You Code**: These are homework exercises, started in class, and completed outside of class.

## Folder structure in this Repository

There are 14 lessons in the course. Each lesson has its own folder under `content/lessons`. Inside each lesson folder you will find folders for `Watch Me Code`, `End-To-End Example`, `In-Class Coding Lab` and and `Now You Code` homework. In the event a folder is missing it implies that lesson does not contain that kind of activity.
