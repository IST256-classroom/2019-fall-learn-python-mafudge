    "# In-Class Coding Lab: Scrape NASDAQ Stock Quotes \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we will walk you through scraping stock data from the NASDAQ website: http://www.nasdaq.com/ \n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk you through the process and when you're done you'll be tasked with creating a program which when given an NASDAQ symbol will retrieve the name of the stock, price, and percent change.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we work through the example, we will use Amazon.com's stock symbol:`amzn` \n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of NASDAQ stocks to try with the completed program, see here: http://www.cnbc.com/nasdaq-100/ \n",

    "2. use BeautifulSoup4 to extract data from the site. save the data we extract into a dict\n",
    "3. print the stock info from the dict\n",
