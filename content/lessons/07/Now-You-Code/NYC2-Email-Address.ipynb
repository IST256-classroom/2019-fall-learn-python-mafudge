    "# Now You Code 2: Is That An Email Address?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use Python's built-in string functions to write our own function to detect if a string is an email address. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `isEmail(text)` should return `True` when `text` is an email address, `False` otherwise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity's sake we will define an email address to be any string with just ONE `@` symbol in it, where the `@` is not at the beginning or end of the string. So `a@b` is considered an email (even though it really isn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should detect emails until you enter quit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sample run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Email address detector. Type quit to exit. \n",
