    "Let's write a basic sentiment analyzer in Python. Sentiment analysis is the act of extracting mood from text. It has practical applications in analyzing reactions in social media, product opinions, movie reviews and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1.0 version of our sentiment analyzer will start with a string of positive and negative words. For any input text and the sentiment score will be calculated by simply adding up the frequency of the positive words, then subtracting out the negative words.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    positive_text = \"happy glad like\"\n",
    "    negative_text = \"angry mad hate\"\n",
    "    input_text = \"Amazon makes me like so angry and mad\"\n",
    "    score = -1 [ +1 for like, -1 for angry, -1 for mad]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete this program by first writing the sentiment function, then writing some tests for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will conclude by writing the complete sentiment analyzer to score any sentence. \n",
